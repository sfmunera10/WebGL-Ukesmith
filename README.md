3D game inspired by Rocksmith: https://rocksmith.ubisoft.com/rocksmith/en-us/home/, but this time is for Ukelele. The purpose of this project is to show off some of the features that the WebGL graphics library can offer for 3D game applications.

2. Run the local server: ./host.command (for Mac) or ./host.bat (for Windows)
